# Quick-Boot-Disk-Info
Inspired by Rich Trouton's "APFS encryption status check script", at https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2017/11/13/apfs-encryption-status-check-script/

This is another in a series of littls ASOC utilites I do here and there. This one gives you a window with the following info for the startup disk:

Disk Identifier
Volume Name
Volume Format
Volume Encryption Status
Volume Total/Used/Free Space
System Version
